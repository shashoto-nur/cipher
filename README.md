# Cipher

A react progressive web app written in typescript to encrypt files in the browser.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run production`

If you don't have the serve package installed, you will need to run `npm install -g serve` before the above command.\
Serves the build folder of the react app on localhost.
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and deploys the build folder to github pages.

### `npm run repo-update`

Runs the following commands sequentially: `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push -u origin main`.

### `npm run package-update`

If you don't have the npm-check-updates package installed, you will need to run `npm install -g npm-check-updates` before the above command.\
Updates the dependency versions in the package.json of the project and installs the latest versions.\

### `npm run eject`

Copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.
